Comment: Hi, if you stumbled to this section of my website looking for a professional resume, here it is a file (insert link) What you see below is a more informal illustration of my experiences and derived learnings. Thanks! ----- This is probably the best phase of life in terms of purely learning and relating concepts to problems around me; now that the learning process is less related to the fear of grades or ranking hierarchy. Unfortunately, that wasn't the case growing up.
