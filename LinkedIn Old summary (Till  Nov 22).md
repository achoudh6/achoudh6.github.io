# Linkedin old summary (Till  Nov 22)

Experienced Mechanical Engineer with strong design, critical thinking and experimental problem-solving skills. Strong research professional and first-gen college graduate with a Master's in Mechanical Engineering from North Carolina State University. Driven, adaptable, resourceful and inquisitive individual eager to learn new things, all the while tackling tough problems and aggressive schedules. Self-taught 3D printing nerd, process control aficionado and a big advocate for open-source design, diversity in teams, MOOCs and continuous learning.

Skilled in design for manufacturing, mechanical behavior of materials, material characterization, additive manufacturing, validation testing and statistical data analysis. Overseas projects experience in automotive R&D and demonstrated success working across teams on manufacturing design, teardown benchmarking (VA/VE), quality control and new product introduction (NPI) as part of Yamahaâ€™s flagship INDRA project that resulted in India's most economic two-wheeler vehicle. Highly interested in processing-structure-property-performance (PSPP) relationships, reliability & failure behavior, and discovering new possibilities for AM design pathways in the concept-to-product cycle.

I'm presently on my post-completion OPT working at the Center for Additive Mfg and Logistics (CAMAL) at NC State on experimental design, qualitative assessment and process-material development in additive manufacturing.

My dream role is to be an individual contributor within a diverse engineering team that uses advanced computational design and characterization tools to solve complex manufacturing challenges and design robust, next-generation consumer products. I'm open to work, willing to relocate and actively interviewing for full-time/contract design-development-reliability engineering roles. Most recently affected by #Covid-19 due to AIRBUS's discontinuation of its International Graduate Program (IGP) 2020.
